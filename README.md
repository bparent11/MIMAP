# MIMAP
Application - Your interactive memory map

I began this personal project in July 2024, but I missed time and I couldn't advance much on it, so I'm waiting for December 2024 to get back on this and finalize it.
As you can see the first commit is already pretty good (I didn't create a github repo as soon as I started), but many features are missing, it will come as soon as I get back on it.

The project is to create an interactive map, where you can save pictures linked to some good memories.

If you want to make it works on your computer that would be pretty difficult. When I am coding I work on my laptop (MySQL and the fictive server are running directly on it). It is likely to be launched when it will be ready.
